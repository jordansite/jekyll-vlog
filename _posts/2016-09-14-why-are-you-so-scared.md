Seriously though! Why is it that you literally scare yourself out of doing the things that you know you will enjoy and the things that will make your life so much better?

You convince yourself that whatever you want to do is too scary yet, don’t even know the outcome. You think about all the bad things that could happen before they even happen.

I don’t know about you but I don’t know anyone who can predict the future! If you know someone ask them for the winning lottery numbers! Please!
Everyone wants to win the lottery right? Everyone has this false hope “if only I won the lottery” NO! Winning the lottery will not make your life any better than it is now because you will still be you and you are not the best you that you can be!
Everyone knows someone who is always negative. They can consistently find the worst in people or things. Always thinking of how bad things can happen.
You will always have these thoughts but you don’t need to listen to them.
I have my Skydiving licence and many adventures such as festivals and 19 day solo camping trips under my belt. What is the worst thing that has happened to me? On one of my camping trips a mouse made its way into my car and I had a road trip buddy for a couple days.
Big deal! I am still alive and healthy. I do love her to death but I know my limits and what I am capable of. If it was up to her I would be living in her apartment for the rest of my life, because that is safe.

There it is that “safe” word again; you all have it programmed in your brains. You need to be safe in order to stay alive.
News flash! You don’t live in a cave anymore! You don’t need to worry about surviving and where your next meal will come from. You have all you need to survive and you don’t even need to leave the SAFETY of your own home.

Stay in bed, watch TV and order pizza. SAFE Right?

Sure you are safe but let’s examine how safe you really need to be in today’s society.
You can use a scale from 1 to 10 for how safe you are in a situation. 1 being a high chance of death and 10 being no chance of death at all.

10 would be staying home, watching TV and ordering food.

1 would be eating rat poison

I know what some of you are saying, there could be an earthquake and your roof could collapse on you. Or who would eat rat poison?

This is where I need you to recognize how your brain reacts to this thing you call fear. You will have an initial first thought. You immediately go with that thought and completely disregard any other options.

My first thought to eating rat poison is; I wonder how much you would actually have to eat in order to die?

But that his how my brain works, I am always curious and eager to learn. No I am not going to eat rat poison but my brain wants to understand things.
Your brain might automatically say rat poison equals death therefore I am not going anywhere near that stuff. This may be your first thought, what I would like you to do is to take that thought into consideration and then see what other thoughts pop into your mind.

Back to the scale, 5 would be going skydiving. From personal experience I can assure you on the safety of skydiving. You have a reserve. The reserve is guaranteed to open at 1000 ft even if you are unconscious.

The only reason it is a 5 is because you could injure yourself on landing and it could get infected and you could die from it if you don’t go to the hospital within a week. See how far of a stretch that scenario is?

That’s only a 5!!! Think to yourself; what do you consider a 5? Or is everything a 10?
