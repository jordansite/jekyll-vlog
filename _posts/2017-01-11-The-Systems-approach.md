### How To Use Systems To Increase Productivity.

When you are productive you are able to do things without thinking. If you spend time thinking, you are consuming valuable time that could be spent doing.

By thinking too much, you can get frustrated. Which may lead to nothing getting done.

This is where systems come in. Once you have a system in place, there is no more thinking.

You simply follow your set of instructions all the way from start to finish. That's it, you are done!

No need to worry, stress or over complicate things.

Using systems has increased my productivity exponentially!

### Tip #1 – Find Where You Need Systems In Your Life

Systems can be placed pretty much anywhere. 

Think of a time where you really needed to focus or you couldn't remember something.

This is where you can implement systems. Using systems will get rid of all the frustrations and worries which saves energy.

Systems are a great tool to maximize your time. They can be used in many places in your day to day life.

Most productive people will use a calendar or schedule. This is a perfect example of a system.

They plan out everything they can and they do it weeks, months. Even years in advance!

By having your week planned out, you don't need to think about what you are doing Tuesday night.
You simply look at you calendar and it will tell you. 

If someone asks you what you did last Thursday. You consult your calendar and tell them. No need to think.

Then when you get asked to do something at a later date, you can let them know if you have the time.

This will lead to you spending more time, on the things you need to focus on. Instead of getting distracted by having too many things to do.

See how effective this one system is? It is amazing the productivity you can get out each and every system that you implement.

If you already use a schedule, find ways to improve it. Once you do that, look to other places where systems can be implemented.

Every system you have makes you more efficient. Why stop at just one?

### Tip #2 – Build A System That Works For You

There are many systems out there that you can reference but at the end of the day, you are the one using it. Make sure to make it your own.

This will make it easier for you to follow your systems later on. Any one can be handed a set of instructions. If you have no attachment to it then you probably won't do it.

By making it your own, your emotions get involved. Your systems are something you create and you should feel good about that!

It is good practice to ask others about the systems they use, in order to gain more knowledge. You do not have to copy their ideas exactly but if it can improve your system then go for it!

Make sure to set aside some time for this as it is worth putting in the effort.

You can also do this multiple times a day. When you become upset or question an experice. Think of how you could implement a system.

By building this habit, you are creating your own system awareness. You might even be surprised by all the times you notice your frustrations or complaints.

### Tip #3 – Follow your system

You have found a spot in your life that needed a system, you made it your own and you are excited to use it everyday!

Awesome! Don't forget to stay focused here. Just because you made a system, doesn't mean all the hard work is done.

The system is in place, use it. Don't question it, don't doubt yourself.

There will be times when you want to veer of path and try something different or might not follow your system at all.

Remember why you made your system and how much it will benefit you. Use this to help you when you get off track.

Then once you are in, stay in and don't leave.

Eventually your system will become a habit, there will be no questioning it. It will flow naturally.

Once this happens, you can add another system to your list.

### Final Thoughts

Systems can be used in many places and are very useful to make the most of your time.

If you are like me, I try to implement them in almost everything I do. It makes me more efficient with my time and frees up space in my head.

I use them for managing my money and my time, also relationships.

By using systems, I have more time and energy to focus on doing the things I enjoy.

I truly appreciate a good system and would love to hear about the systems you use in your lives!
