## When to Think Ahead and When to Stop Yourself!

How does our mind think so far ahead when it really has no idea what will happen?

We focus on what might happen, in order to prepare ourselves for the future.

This can be great in some aspects but it can also send you in a downward spiral.

### Think Ahead

#### Short Term

There are few moments in life when thinking ahead is crucial, one being before you are about to perform. Perform in anything, whether it be a job interview or a snowboarding competition.

These types of activities need to be perfected in the mind before they can be flawlessly displayed. By visualizing them in your head, you know exactly what to do. 

When you are doing this, you are only processing the next couple hours or a day at most. You are not looking 4 years into the future and planning out your new house with your family.

Using this technique allows you to perform your best.

#### Long Term

This can be anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 years. 

If you want to think long term, you need to do it momentarily. A quick thought of where you see yourself in the future.

This may be finishing school or your next career choice. Picture your dreams and goals.

If you don't have an image or a vision inside your head of where you want to be, how will you ever end up there?

The key is to have that vision and stick with it! Maybe you have a dream home or vacation destination you want to go to.

You need to visualize what this will look and feel like. Do this for only a minute or two, when you are feeling discouraged or down on yourself.

By doing this for a short period of time. It will bring you the joy needed, to you push forward.

That being said, don't be dreaming for 3 hours every night!

If you do this, you will become satisfied with the thoughts inside your head and might not take any action.

Thinking long term is a temporary thought to help guide you to where you want to be. 

It is not meant to help escape your current reality, only push you into a better one.


### Stop Yourself

#### You Have No Motivation

When you have been thinking so far ahead into the future that you lose all your energy. 

By focusing on all the things you want to do and how far away they are, you will get frustrated. Once you are frustrated, it's over!

You have all these dreams that you can place yourself in, yet all you do is think about how nice they would be.

This is where you need bring awareness to your thoughts, stop and ask yourself one question.

Why am I thinking about my dream and not acting on it?

Listen to yourself.


#### Your Picturing a Negative Future

This can take a turn for the worst, not only is your present negative but your future becomes negative too.

This is something that is very difficult to deal with, please find professional help if you can.

If all you think of is how terrible your life is now and your future will be. Then guess what?

It will be! As hard as it is to find the positives, try to slide them in with the negatives.

By doing this you will slowly push out the bad thoughts and bring in the good ones.

### Action Steps

#### Short Term For The Long Term

Think about the long term for brief moments, it will keep you focused.

It only takes a minute or 2 in order to visualize your dream. See it, feel it, motivate!

That is it! No need to sit and ponder for an hour on what it would be like. 

That hour could be spent working on getting to that dream, use it!

#### Positive Thoughts

If you do find yourself stuck in your future self, do your best to make it a better future self.

Make it seem impossible and make sure to promise that you will do all you can to get there.

Don't focus on how impossible it is, focus on how to get there.

When you try to get there, this is when you discover new things along the way. It is the most important part!

The journey and learning during your process to get to your future, that is what life is all about!

### Final Thoughts

Thinking about the future can be very useful or it can crush you.

Make sure to focus on the future you want and it will come. 

Don't focus on all the bad things that will happen, instead visualize all the good things.

By doing this you will be amazed at how you are able to make your thoughts become reality!
