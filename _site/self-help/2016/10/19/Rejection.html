Yes that is right, I am talking about rejection! Some people will live their entire lives fearing rejection and others will fight it. I choose to fight it and you should too!</p> <h3 id="therapy">Therapy</h3> <p>I stumbled upon this thing called rejection therapy. Sounds weird right? Why do I need therapy for rejection? Well, turns out rejection therapy is just facing your fear of rejection over and over again.</p> <p>One thing many men fear is getting rejected when approaching a female. Some even fear it so much they won’t even start a conversation! Instead of letting that fear take over…</p> <h3 id="why-dont-you-try-something-different">Why don’t you try something different?</h3> <p>Instead of approaching a girl with the hope that she will immediately fall in love with you. Go in with the mindset that you will 100% get rejected, that’s right! Rejected!</p> <p>Think about this for a second. If you know you are going to get rejected then you have nothing to fear. The worst case scenario is that you get rejected, which you already planned for! This will train your mind to accept rejection as a normal everyday feeling and not something that will cause you harm. Having this mindset will result in you being more relaxed and confident. Which may lead to having a great conversation. Woo Hoo! Go you!</p> <h3 id="repeat">Repeat</h3> <p>Now this will take some practice and believe me. It took a lot of rejections, not only with girls. I constantly try to get rejected to remind myself that failure is always an option. By repeatedly getting rejected you will no longer fear rejection.</p> <p>Think about how much better your life would be if you never had the fear of rejection. How many more girls would you talk to? How many more questions would you ask? The possibilities are endless and by practising this; you will keep growing.</p> <p>Rejection happens to us every day and it can hurt a lot; if you let it.</p> <p>Rejection is all inside your head and makes you feel awful about yourself. Why then do we let it control us and create this fear inside our minds?</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>If you are face rejection everyday for 60 days, think about how much more comfortable you might be when getting rejected. You can compare this back to going to the gym, if you went to the gym every day for 60 days in a row you would not only lose weight but gain a lot of muscle! And that goes for anything: reading, writing, drawing, playing a musical instrument or even learning a new language.</p> <p>If you put 60 days into anything you will achieve results! Start now and you will be amazed at what you can do! Some of you might be thinking, 60 days is a long time. It equals out to two months or 8 weeks. Compare that to your entire existence on this planet.</p> <p>Two months is no time at all. I have started thinking two to three years ahead. If you want to be great at something, it takes years. Not days. Not weeks but YEARS. If you still have a fear of rejection after doing it for two months than you might need to see an expert for advice.</p> <p>I am not an expert by any means… I am just like you.</p> </section> </article> </main> <section id="contact"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center"> <h2 class="section-heading">Let's Get In Touch!</h2> <hr class="primary"> <p>Ready to start the conversation?
