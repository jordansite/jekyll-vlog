Some of us are aware of this battle, others have yet to become aware. Think of your brain as a game.</p> <p>A game that can be won but it can also be lost. This is part of life. It is how we play this game that affects who we become.</p> <p>How many times have you said “I would or I wish (fill in the blank)” and how many times have you successfully completed XYZ? This is the constant battle between you and your brain. But how does the brain work?</p> <p>The brain works on repetition. Has anyone ever told you “practice makes perfect” or the more you work on something the better you will become?</p> <p>Why don’t you listen? There is an underlying cause for this and you are not at fault.</p> <p>The reason you don’t listen is due to the fact that practice is not comfortable. Our brain craves comfort and our brain likes to solve problems. When you are solving problems, you are uncomfortable. Your brain will only go so far until it shuts down due to overload. Everyone wants to feel good about themselves and our brain will do anything to get that feeling.</p> <p>It will make things up like, “I want to be active but I don’t have time”. Who has said this to themselves before? This is our brain winning the game. You convince yourself that it is okay not to go to the gym. Your brain is saying “we don’t know what to do at the gym so here is excuse ABC why we shouldn’t go to the gym and instead we are going stay comfortable at home watching TV.”</p> <p>Does this sound familiar? Your brain will only put energy to things that have a known outcome. Simply saying “I want to work out 3 times a week” is not going to get you anywhere. Your brain does not know how to work out and it then throws away any thoughts of working out.</p> <p>Netflix is a great example. Your brain knows that if you watch a movie it will be stimulated by escaping your reality and getting lost in the movie. Your brain knows that this is comforting and safe. Your brain just won. How many times has your brain won? Are you seeing the pattern here?</p> <p>Think back to when mankind lived in caves and had no technology. I know, sounds crazy right? Back then our brains were programmed to survive. This meant having a safe shelter, food and water. That’s it! By watching Netflix we have all of these comforts. That is why watching Netflix is easy and your brain is happy. But you are not.</p> <p>That is right. You are not happy, this is a trick your brain plays on you.</p> <p>Your brain wins every time you watch Netflix and every time you watch Netflix, your brain keeps score. If you keep letting your brain win, it gets harder and harder for you to fight back and take the lead.</p> <p>We can fight back and take the lead to make sure our brain does not win any more times than needed. We can win the game.</p> <p>How do you win the brain game?</p> <p>If all of this is new to you then start slow and ease into it.</p> <p>You will need to start a long term battle with your brain and focus on the positive outcomes that will come in the near future!</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, your brain may be winning the game but it is easy to catch up and start winning.</p> <p>Keeping with the movie theme, try and notice how you feel before, during and after watching a movie.</p> <p>Think about why you decided to watch the movie in the first place. Were you bored? Maybe it helps you fall asleep?</p> <p>Consider the why and challenge your thoughts.</p> <p>By being aware of your thoughts, you can begin the process of winning the brain game.</p> <p>Everyone likes to win!</p> <p>Why not win the most important game of all?</p> </section> </article> </main> <section id="contact"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center"> <h2 class="section-heading">Let's Get In Touch!</h2> <hr class="primary"> <p>Ready to start the conversation?
