Days Off With Jordan - EP 013

In this video Jordan Tomasone travels to Quebec and climbs a few mountains during his stay, first with skies climbing Blanc Montagne and then with snowshoes climbing the two mountains in between Mont Saint Pierre and Mont Louis. 

Jordan felt that Quebec was an amazing experience and the people he was able to meet here were so welcoming and accepting, this is a new favourite and Jordan will be seeking opportunities to return in the future.
