Days Off With Jordan - EP 014

This week I visited Matane and attended the Mega Drag Quality Inn & Suites Matane 2017, the last snowmobile drag race competition of the season! Where the best of the best from all around North America came to compete with sleds reaching up to and over 140 MPH at 600 Horsepower!
