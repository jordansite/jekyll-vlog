Days off With Jordan - EP 018

Watch as Jordan takes an adventure to Niagara falls, visiting the amazing falls at night for the light show, during the day for the amazing views, dancing in the street at night just for fun, and taking a hike to finish out the rest of the day. The views at Niagara falls was unlike anything I have experienced before, visiting during winter gave tress nearby a cool crystal like effect.
