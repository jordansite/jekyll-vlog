Days off with Jordan - EP 005

In this video Jordan tours around Dublin, Ireland, checking out Dublin Castle, stopping at the Guinness Store House for a tour around the facilities and a pint of Real Guinness and finally stopping in at the Teeling Whiskey Distillery for a quick look around.
This is part 2 of a 5 part series of my adventures in Ireland, new videos every 2 weeks.
